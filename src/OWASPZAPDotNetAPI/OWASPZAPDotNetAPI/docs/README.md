The Dot Net API for OWASP ZAP allows you to access the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy's functionality programmatically to enable automated vulnerability analysis for web applications.

This package is a fork from the original soure [zaproxy/zap-api-dotnet](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-api-dotnet). I just updated the package to .NET 8.0 and resolved the deprecation warnings. All the attribuition should go to the original author.
